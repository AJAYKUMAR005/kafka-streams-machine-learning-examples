#Machine Learning + Kafka Streams Examples

This project includes demos which demonstrate how to deploy analytic models to mission-critical, scalable production leveraging Apache Kafka's Streams API.
Examples will include analytic models built with TensorFlow, Keras, H2O, Python, DeepLearning4J and other technologies.

You can need to clone this project and run ‘maven clean package’ to compile sources and run unit tests.

Example #1: 
Use Case: Gradient Boosting Method (GBM) to predict flight delays:
Technology: H2O generated Java model + Kafka Streams
